**Nail Image Processing**
==========================

**Overview**
------------

This project is a Python-based image processing system for analyzing nail images. The system loads a raw nail image and a labeled image, integrates the labeled image, and saves the resulting image. The system also provides an optional interactive labeling feature.

**Getting Started**
---------------

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9
* OpenCV library (install using `pip install opencv-python`)
* numpy library (install using `pip install numpy`)

### Running the System

1. Save the `nail_image_processing.py` file in a directory of your choice.
2. Replace the `raw_image_path` and `labeled_image_path` variables in the `nail_image_processing.py` file with the actual paths to your raw nail image and labeled image, respectively.
3. Run the system using Python (e.g., `python nail_image_processing.py`).

**Features**
------------

### Image Loading

* Loads a raw nail image and a labeled image using OpenCV.

### Image Pre-processing (Optional)

* Converts the raw image to grayscale using OpenCV.

### Label Integration

* Integrates the labeled image with the raw image by assigning class labels to each pixel.

### Interactive Labeling (Optional)

* Provides an interactive labeling feature that allows users to manually label pixels in the image.

### Image Saving

* Saves the integrated labeled image as a PNG file.
